## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Little Birds are dining  
Warily and well,  
Hid in mossy cell:  
Hid, I say, by waiters  
Gorgeous in their gaiters -  
I've a Tale to tell.  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
I find no peace, and all my war is done.  
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.  
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;  
And nought I have, and all the world I seize on.  
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison  
And holdeth me not—yet can I scape no wise—  
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,  
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.  
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.  
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
